    <h2 class="mb-4">Polygon Drawing Test Instructions</h2>
    <p>This is your third and final test. In this test, you will use the polygon tool to draw shapes, which is commonly used in image segmentation for artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Drawing Shapes:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Click to Create Points:</strong> Use the polygon tool to draw shapes by clicking on the edges of the shape. For example, a square has four edges, so you will click on the four corners of the square to create the shape.</li>

   <img class="my-1 w-75" src="./images/t3/2.png" alt="01"/>
   <img class="my-1 w-75" src="./images/t3/3.png" alt="01"/>
   <img class="my-1 w-75" src="./images/t3/4.png" alt="01"/>
  <hr>
      <li><strong>Fill the Shape:</strong> Once you have clicked on all the edges of the shape, press the "Enter" key on your keyboard to fill the shape with the color red.</li>

  <hr>
    <img class="my-1 w-75" src="./images/t3/5.png" alt="01"/>
  <hr>
      <li><strong>Simple Completion:</strong> It's that simple! Just click on the edges of the shape and press "Enter" to complete the shape with a red fill.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Other Functions of the Tool:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Delete a Point:</strong> If you make a mistake or your line is crooked, use the "Backspace" key on your keyboard to delete a point. This will take you to the previous point, helping you correct your line.</li>

     <img class="my-1 w-75" src="./images/t3/7.png" alt="01"/>
  <hr>

      <li><strong>Delete a Shape:</strong> If your shape is already filled with the red color, pressing "Backspace" will not undo the shape. Instead, use the "Undo" button or the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Z" to delete the entire shape.</li>


      <li><strong>Zoom In and Out:</strong> To adjust the image size for better precision, use the zoom in and out buttons in the tool menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts "+" and "-" after "0" to zoom in or out.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4"><strong>Important Note:</strong></p>
    <p>You are required to label only the square, the triangle, and the three rectangular shapes in this test.</p>

    <p>Once you have completed the test, inform the instructor before you leave.</p>

    <p>We wish you the best of luck in completing the test! If you have any questions, feel free to ask the instructor.</p>
